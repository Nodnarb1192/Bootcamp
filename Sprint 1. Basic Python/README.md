# Music Preferences Analysis: Springfield vs Shelbyville

## Project Description
In the field of analytics, formulating and testing hypotheses is vital for decision making. Accepting or rejecting these hypotheses allows businesses to ascertain whether they are making the right assumptions.

In this project, we delve into the comparison of music preferences between the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. Leveraging real data from Yandex.Music, we aim to test several hypotheses and draw insights on user behavior specific to these two cities.

## Hypotheses
We are setting out to test the following hypotheses:
1. User activity varies depending on the day of the week and differs from city to city.
2. Residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres on Monday mornings, and this pattern repeats on Friday evenings.
3. The residents of Springfield and Shelbyville have different music preferences. It is assumed that Springfield residents prefer pop, while Shelbyville residents tend to favor rap.
