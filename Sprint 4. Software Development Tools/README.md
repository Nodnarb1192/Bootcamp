## Description

First we took the dataset and performed some basic exploratory data analysis, and cleaned up the data. Then we created a streamlit app to help vizualize the data with a couple interactive graphs. The app is deployed on render.com. The link to the app is [here](https://sprint4-ygzc.onrender.com/).
